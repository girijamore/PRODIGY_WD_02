This project is developed as part of the Prodigy InfoTech Web Development Internship - Task 2. The objective is to build a fully functional Stopwatch Web Application using core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The stopwatch allows users to:

Start the timer

Pause it

Reset the time

Track lap times

This project demonstrates how JavaScript can be used for real-time functionality and precise time tracking, while HTML and CSS handle the structure and responsive styling of the UI.
